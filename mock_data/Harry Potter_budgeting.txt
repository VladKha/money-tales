Harry Potter and the Magical Money Plan

One sunny morning at Hogwarts, Harry Potter woke up with a big smile. Today was special because Hogsmeade weekend was here! He couldn't wait to visit Honeydukes for chocolate frogs and Zonko's for magical jokes. But as he reached for his money bag, something felt different. It was lighter than usual.

"Uh-oh," Harry muttered. "I don’t think I have enough gold."

Ron Weasley yawned and sat up in bed. "What’s wrong, mate?"

"I only have five Galleons left," said Harry. "And I want to buy so many things today!"

Hermione Granger, who had been reading her book, looked over. "Maybe you should make a plan before we go shopping," she suggested wisely. "Budgeting is important, even in the wizarding world."

"A what?" asked Ron, scratching his head.

"A budget," Hermione explained. "It means deciding how much you’ll spend on each thing ahead of time. That way, you won’t run out of money too quickly."

Harry thought about it. "Okay, let’s try that. How do I start?"

Hermione pulled out a piece of parchment and started writing. "First, write down everything you want to buy. Then decide how much gold to spend on each item."

Together, they made a list:
- Chocolate Frogs: 2 Galleons
- Exploding Snap cards: 1 Galleon
- A new quill from Scrivenshaft’s: 1 Galleon
- Something fun but unexpected: 1 Galleon

"That adds up perfectly!" said Hermione, clapping her hands. "Now stick to your plan when we’re in Hogsmeade."

When they arrived at Hogsmeade, Harry stuck close to his friends. At Honeydukes, the shelves were filled with colorful candies. Harry picked two boxes of Chocolate Frogs just like he planned. Next, they visited Zonko’s Joke Shop, where Ron found some Dungbombs he wanted. Harry laughed but reminded himself not to stray from his budget.

At Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, Harry admired all the shiny quills. One caught his eye—it sparkled like stars! Even though it cost more than he expected, he remembered his budget and chose a simpler one instead.

Finally, there was 1 Galleon left for something unexpected. As they strolled past Dervish and Banges, Harry spotted a small jar labeled *Invisibility Potion Sample*. It wasn’t much, but it could be useful someday. He bought it, feeling proud of sticking to his plan.

On the way back to Hogwarts, Ron held up his bag of sweets. "This was such a great day! Thanks for sharing your treats, Harry."

Harry grinned. "And thanks to Hermione for teaching me about budgets. Now I didn’t waste my gold, and I still got everything I needed—and even something extra!"

Hermione smiled. "See? Budgeting isn’t boring; it’s actually kind of magical. You can enjoy yourself without worrying about running out of money."

From then on, whenever Harry received gold, he always made a plan first. Whether it was saving for Christmas presents or planning another trip to Hogsmeade, he learned that being careful with his coins helped him make smarter choices.

And so, Harry discovered that just like spells, a good budget could work wonders too.
