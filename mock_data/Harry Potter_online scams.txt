Harry Potter and the Sneaky Online Spell

One sunny afternoon at Hogwarts, Harry Potter was sitting in the Gryffindor common room with his best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. They were chatting about their latest adventure when Hedwig swooped in with a letter tied to her leg. Harry untied it curiously and read aloud, "Congratulations, Harry! You've won 1,000 Galleons in the Wizarding Web Sweepstakes!"

Ron's eyes widened. "Blimey, Harry! That's enough to buy a lifetime supply of Chocolate Frogs!"

Hermione frowned and crossed her arms. "Wait a minute. Did you even enter a contest, Harry?"

Harry shook his head. "No, I don’t think so."

"Exactly," said Hermione. "This sounds fishy. Let’s investigate before we do anything."

The trio decided to visit Professor McGonagall, who was known for her wisdom and love of cats. When they showed her the letter, she adjusted her glasses and said, "Ah, this is what we call an online scam. Some sneaky wizards or witches try to trick people into giving away their information or money by pretending to offer something amazing."

"But how does it work?" asked Ron.

Professor McGonagall explained, "Imagine someone sends you a message saying you’ve won a broomstick, but first, you need to send them your vault key to claim it. Once they have your key, they can take all your gold without you realizing it until it's too late."

Harry gasped. "That’s terrible!"

"It is," agreed Professor McGonagall. "But there are ways to protect yourself. Always check if the offer is real by asking trusted adults or looking for clues that it might be fake. And never share personal information like passwords or vault keys online."

Feeling inspired, Harry, Ron, and Hermione decided to spread the word about online scams to their fellow students. They created posters with fun rhymes like:

"If it seems too good to be true,  
A scam might be waiting just for you!  
Ask a teacher, ask a friend,  
Before you click or send."

Soon, everyone at Hogwarts knew how to spot a scam. Even Peeves the Poltergeist stopped playing tricks on students long enough to listen to Hermione explain why sharing secrets online wasn’t wise.

A few days later, another owl arrived with a new letter for Harry. This time, it was from Gringotts Bank, thanking him for being cautious and rewarding him with a small bag of Galleons for helping educate others about staying safe online.

As they sat by the lake counting the coins, Ron grinned. "See? Being careful pays off—literally!"

Harry nodded. "And now we know: if something feels wrong or too magical to be true, it’s better to double-check than risk losing everything."

From then on, Harry and his friends became heroes not just for fighting dark wizards but also for teaching everyone the importance of staying smart and safe in the wizarding world—and beyond.

The end.
