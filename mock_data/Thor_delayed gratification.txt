Thor and the Golden Apples

Once upon a time in the magical land of Asgard, Thor, the mighty god of thunder, loved to feast on golden apples. These apples were not just any fruit—they were special because they gave him strength and energy to protect his friends and family. But there was one rule: each apple tree only grew three apples every month.

One sunny morning, Thor woke up with a rumbling tummy. "I could really use a golden apple right now!" he said as he walked to the orchard. When he arrived, he saw three shiny, juicy apples hanging from the tree. His mouth watered just looking at them.

"Wow, these look delicious!" Thor exclaimed. He reached out to grab all three apples. But before he could pluck them, a wise old owl named Odin swooped down and said, "Hold on, young Thor! Do you really need all three apples today?"

Thor scratched his head. "Well, I'm hungry now, so... yes?"

Odin chuckled. "If you eat all three today, what will you eat next week when you're hungry again? Those apples won’t grow back for another whole month."

Thor paused. He hadn't thought about that. "Hmm," he said, tapping his chin. "What should I do?"

Odin smiled kindly. "Why not take just one apple today? That way, you’ll have two left for later. You can enjoy this apple now and still have some saved for when you truly need them."

Thor frowned. "But it’s so hard to wait! These apples are so yummy!"

"I know," said Odin. "Waiting isn’t always easy, but it makes the reward even sweeter. Imagine how happy you’ll be next week when you’re tired or hungry and you still have an apple waiting for you."

Thor thought about it for a moment. Then he nodded. "Okay, I’ll try it your way. One apple today and two for later." Carefully, he picked one golden apple and took a big bite. It tasted amazing!

Over the next few weeks, Thor practiced patience. Whenever he felt like eating more than one apple, he reminded himself how good it would feel to save some for later. And guess what? Every time he waited, he felt proud of himself—and the apples he saved tasted extra delicious!

One day, a big storm hit Asgard. The winds blew fiercely, and everyone needed Thor’s help to keep them safe. After hours of swinging his hammer and battling the storm, Thor was exhausted. But then he remembered—he still had two golden apples left!

He ate one apple, and instantly, his strength returned. With renewed energy, he finished protecting the kingdom and brought peace back to Asgard. Everyone cheered for their brave hero.

Later that evening, Thor sat under the starry sky with Odin. "You know," Thor said, "waiting wasn’t so bad after all. Saving those apples helped me when I needed them most."

Odin nodded wisely. "That’s the magic of patience, my friend. Sometimes, waiting a little while makes the reward much bigger and better."

From that day on, Thor became known not just as the god of thunder, but also as the god of smart choices. And whenever someone in Asgard wanted a treat too soon, they’d remember Thor and his golden apples.

The end.
